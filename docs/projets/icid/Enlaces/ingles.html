                History:
            </h3>
            <p>
                The Fortress is now part of the national park of Santa Teresa, created to protect it

            </p>
            <p>
                The current Santa Teresa Fortress was built by the Spanish crown, although its 
                foundation and name are due to Portugal. In the short period of October from 1765 to 1775
                 three fortifications were built.

            </p>
            <p>

                The signing of the Treaty of El Pardo (1761) effectively annulled the Treaty of Madrid 
                (1750), so the governor and captain general of the captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, Gomes 
                Freire de Andrade, count of Bobadela, anticipated the consequences of it for the southern
                 region, which he knew well. He ordered the governor of the Colonia do Río Grande de São 
                 Pedro, Colonel Elói Madureira, to immediately send troops from Laguna to the Linea de 
                 Castillos Grande. The troops were commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Tomás Luis de Osorio, 
                 commander of the Cavalry troops of the Dos Dragones Regiment and of Fort Jesús, María, 
                 José de Río Pardo.

            </p>
            <p>
                Gathering just over a thousand men, the Portuguese strategy was to quickly build a 
                fortified defensive line, south of Fort San Miguel on Chuí Stream, to stop the Spanish 
                invasion in progress, after the conquest of Colonia del Sacramento in October 1762 by 
                the governor of Buenos Aires, Pedro de Ceballos, at the head of nearly three thousand 
                men gathered in Maldonado.
            </p>
            <p>
                Osorio had a field fortification built in December 1762, garnishing it with about 400 
                soldiers and artillerying it with some small caliber pieces. The place chosen was the 
                Angostura gorge near the Castillos Grande mountain, closing the land road along the 
                coast, which went from Colonia del Sacramento to the town of Río Grande.
